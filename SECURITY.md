# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

During v0.x.y development, this project will not support security issues. Once and if we get to v1, then we can start officially supporting security vulnerabilities.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.x.y   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

I will not worry too much about security while developing this thing. But, for now it seems that Github bots say its all good for now. If you find something we should update, please let me know by creating an issue. Thank you.
